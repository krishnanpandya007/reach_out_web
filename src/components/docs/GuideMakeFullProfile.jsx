        <p>Making a fully informed profile makes it trusty among all users as well as we'll consider as a DecentUser :D</p>
        <p>You can make your profile by following the touch ups shown up on home screen when you open up your APK. which are proving bio, profilePicture and linking social(s)</p>

        <pre>{'>'} Provide Bio</pre>
        <small>Make sure that your profile bio is a unique identifier which includes information indicating your profile on other linked medias / you can provide any description you want but keep in mind, this is what people see after possible name collision and identify you as 'YOU'. </small>
        
        <pre>{'>'} Provide ProfilePic</pre>
        <small>First glance identifier, easy to setup. Choose from gallery or take snapshot directly through camera in your apk. upload it and your avatar rocks among your profile. </small>

        <pre>{'>'} Link Social</pre>
        <small>Dude, don't forgot why you make profile on this platform which is to connect your socials it required one time sign-In for security reasons. one of them is that nobody else can link your social handle without authorizing as you.</small>
